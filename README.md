Designing of a device for accurately measuring NPK, Temperature and Humidity of the soil

The soil NPK sensor is suitable for detecting the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in
the soil. It helps in determining the fertility of the soil thereby facilitating the systematic assessment
of the soil condition. The sensor can be buried in the soil for a long time.

DS18B20 is a programmable single-wire temperature sensor. Its main applications include
temperature measurement in harsh environments such as mines and soil. The temperature sensor
can measure a wide temperature range with an accuracy of ±5°C.

A capacitive soil moisture sensor works by measuring the change in capacitance. In simple terms,
capacitance measures the amount of electrical charge that can be stored across an electrical
potential. It is use to measure moisture content of soil.

**Project objective**

• Measure NPK value of soil

• Measure temperature of soil

• Measure moisture content of soil

• Display the measured values of soil using thingspeak

**Methodology**

The soil nutrient content can be easily measured using NPK Soil Sensor. Measurement of soil
content N (nitrogen), P (phosphorus), and K (potassium) is necessary to determine how much
additional nutrient content is to be added to soil to increase crop fertility. The soil fertility is detected
using NPK sensors. During test we will ensure that the steel needle does not touch hard objects,
throw away the surface soil according to the required measurement depth, and maintain the original
tightness of the soil below. Test can be performed by holding the sensor vertically and insert it into
the soil.

During measurement of moisture content of soil, we will use capacitive soil moisture sensor which
take some time to equalize and give a steady reading, so be sure to wait approximately 1 minute
after the sensor settles to a given value. It should settle in 1-5 minutes, depending on the saturation
level of the soil. Under the assumption of a successful calibration, we can take the data and analyse
it.
We can measure the temperature of soil by putting temperature inside soil and get the result on
thingspeak server.
